# Slime Game

**Slime Game** is a top-down action RPG developed using Lua and the LOVE2D framework. In this game, you control a slime who must battle enemies in each room to progress. With each floor consisting of multiple rooms, your goal is to defeat all enemies in each room to unlock the next. Once all rooms on a floor are cleared, youâ€™ll be able to ascend to the next floor.

As the slime, you'll wield various weapons to take down enemies. Each enemy has unique attack patterns and movements, keeping you on your toes as you advance. Inspired by the classic gameplay style of *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*, this game challenges your skills and strategy as you navigate through floors, defeat enemies, and face progressively tougher challenges.
